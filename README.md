2. CodeBook.md - Describes the variables, data and transformations for obtaining the tidy data file from the raw data files
3. run_analysis.R - This is the R script that creates the Tidy data set from the input set of data files
4. Github submission and folder where the files can be found - https://github.com/penumsa/datasciencecoursera

The overall objective is to generate an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each 

subject from the input data provided and applying a set of transformations on this input data
